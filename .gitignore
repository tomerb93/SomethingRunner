This .gitignore configuration should help keep your repository clean by excluding unnecessary files and folders that can be regenerated locally. Make sure to adapt it according to your project's specific needs and any additional tooling you might be using. Always review your repository's status after adding these rules to ensure that you're not ignoring essential files inadvertently.
